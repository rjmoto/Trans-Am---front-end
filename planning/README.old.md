# Trans Am Time Machines

#### Software Engineering Capstone Project

This web app will utilize React and Contentful in an effort to produce an asthetically pleasing and easy to navigate reproduction of Trans Am Specialites' website (https://transamflorida.com/index.htm), focusing on their core services for this project's MVP.

This project was inspired by transamflorida.com, also known as Trans Am Specialities.  The owners have kindly granted permission for the use of their photos and content for the purposes of this demo project.

 is an auto shop in Florida that specializes in restoring classic Pontiac Trans Ams, especially the popular second generation Trans Ams, among other makes and models.  I have been a fan of Trans Am specialities since I first acquired my own Firebird, and I've found them to be an authority on these classics.  In addition to restoring these iconic cars for clients around the globe, they also sell parts and do consignment sales; they are in essence a one stop shop for all things Trans Am.
